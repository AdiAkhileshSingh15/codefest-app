        '"Listening to the data is important; but so is experience and intuition. After all, what is intuition at its best but large amount of data of all kinds, filtered through a human brain rather than a math model?" Thus Codefest presents you to our Machine Learning Event "Enigma". As Big Data is the hottest trend in the tech industry at the moment, machine learning is incredibly powerful to make predictions or calculated suggestions based on large amounts of data. It has its place everywhere now, be it driverless cars, biometric systems or recommendation systems. In the event, data analysts need to design a model which learns from itself and provide efficient solutions to real-life problems.',
